The customer-sales data consists of the sales data for the financial year 2020-2021. The main aim is to explore how the sales were affected with different parameters like Age, month, per state, each region, with discount and quntity and gender.  The initial data wrangling on the dataset was performed using Python and the interactive vizualisation was made using Tableau.
