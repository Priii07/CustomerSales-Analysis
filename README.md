# CustomerSales-Analysis

The customer-sales data consists of the sales data for the financial year 2020-2021. The main aim is to explore how the sales are varying with different parameters like Age, Month-wise Revenue, the Revenue generated per state, the Region wise revenue, how the revenue varies with discount and quntity and the how gender plays an important role in revenue generation. The initial data wrangling on the dataset was performed using Python and the interactive vizualisation was made using Tableau.
